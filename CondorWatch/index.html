          <h1>Condor Watch</h1>
          <p>
            Condor Watch has been a long-lived project, soaring across an ever-expanding
            range, much like the birds whose lives this project catalogs. And we wouldn’t
            have even gotten off the ground without you, our volunteers! For years,
            Condor Watchers have carefully documented feeding positions and chatted
            about scale antics and juvenile floofs. We cannot thank you enough for
            the many hours devoted to this project.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the past two years, photos processed by Condor Watchers have been
            analyzed by Lisa Natale, a graduate student at University of Colorado
            with a background in pure mathematics. Lisa gave us our first detailed
            look at the social networks of California condors based on your Condor
            Watch data! She used social rank, determined from feeding order and
            carcass proximity in photos, to predict an individual’s future risk
            of lead poisoning. Her initial results are informative. One factor
            that can obscure the links between dominance and lead-poisoning risk
            is a striking and unexpected lack of stability in condor social networks,
            especially early in the condor release program. We are excited to use
            Condor Watch data to investigate what contributed to early social
            instability and what led to increasing stability through time. A
            stable social network is likely essential to a well-functioning wild
            flock and may prove to be critical to successful recovery for these
            gregarious birds. You can read more about Lisa’s work here.

            The data analysis baton is being passed to Dr. David Zonana, also of
            University of Colorado, who specializes in animal social networks.
            Because Zooniverse has discontinued the platform hosting Condor Watch,
            the project has gone offline while David refines and expands our
            existing analyses.
          </p>
          <p>
            We plan to refine and re-boot Condor Watch based on the results of
            David’s analyses this summer, with the aim of streamlining photo
            processing tasks to improve the volunteer experience and to speed
            data collection. Look for Condor Watch 2.0 to relaunch on Zooniverse's
            new platform!
