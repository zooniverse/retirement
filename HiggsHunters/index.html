          <h1>Higgs Hunters</h1>
          <p>
            Congratulations! Over 37,000 citizen scientists, from more than 170
            countries, became part of the team to search for interesting features
            in LHC data. Over 1 million classifications were made, and both
            searches for new long-lived particles and weird events were successful.
          </p>
          <p>
            There were some surprising events – including observation of a
            “weird event” - a jet of muon particles in the ATLAS detector, which
            got the scientists very excited, and provoked a lot of head-scratching.
            It turned out to be caused by a rare detector process where a shower
            of particles from the calorimeter can produce what appears to be many
            muons, so a very interesting detector artifact. So no Nobel prize for
            this yet, but it certainly got us excited!
          </p>
          <p>
            The results were excellent. We found that citizen scientists could compete
            very well with computer algorithms in the analysis of collider data from
            CERN, performing better for many of the searches. There have been two
            publications so far: the first describing the (very impressive) ability
            of the collective set of citizen scientists to detect new phenomena in
            images of collisions and the second describing community engagement
            with the project.
          </p>
          <p>
            HiggsHunters on the Zooniverse platform has beem followed with a schools
            project, run in partnership with the Institute of Research in Schools,
            in which school students have been performing further analysis of the
            classifications. Each group generated their own investigation, choosing
            an aspect to investigate, producing results and analysis of the results.
            School analysis included clustering algorithms, complex machine learning
            algorithms, and databases for large data analysis. School students submitting
            research posters to the Department of Physics in Oxford at a two-day seminar
            in Oxford in Summer 2018. The proceedings of this conference have been
            submitted for review by colleagues at CERN.
